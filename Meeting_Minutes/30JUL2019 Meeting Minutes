Hello Everyone,

Below are the minutes from our meeting this evening

Agenda
-	Compare model outputs and write-ups for Q1

-	Begin/Share results from explanatory analysis of the dataset for Q2
o	Will begin this item on Friday, time permitting
Recommendations

Reannan
•	For question 2 considering school district, and/or income would be beneficial
•	10 coefficients is generally a good number of coefficients
•	Interaction terms ie. garage*kitchen

David
•	Following code generates useful assumption check plots without writing too many lines of code

sale_price
summary(sale_price)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(sale_price, which=1)
plot(sale_price, which=2)
plot(sale_price, which=3)
plot(sale_price, which=4)
plot(sale_price, which=2,1)
