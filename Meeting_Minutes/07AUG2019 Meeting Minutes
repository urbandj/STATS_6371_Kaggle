Action Items

Adam: 
- remove NAs from data
- Considate merging and cleaning code onto one file
- consolidate graphs onto a separate file
- export cleaned and merged data to csv and post on Git

Daniel
- Tackle this portion of the requirements document:
	"Specifically, you should produce 4 models: one from forward selection, 
	 one from backwards elimination, one from stepwise selection, and one 
	 that you build custom."  

Jeff
- Update master code to included factored data

Reannan
- Debug LotFrontage, LotArea


Once Adam has the master training file on Git, we can all play with the model using the kaggle_model.r file

Rename Variables
