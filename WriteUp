Question 1 observations:

After including sales price and using the “train” dataset we have collected information on the following neighborhoods: NAmes, Edwards, and BrkSide.  We are analyzing the significance of Living Area by square feet and the relationship to Sales Price in these three neighborhoods.  

The data has been cleaned to remove any missing values in Sales Price, Living Area and Neighborhoods.  The interested output is 383 observations - NAmes has 225 observations, Edwards has 100 and BrkSide has 58 observations.

The visual test of normality in a scatter plot shows a linear relationship between Living Area and Sales Price in the three neighborhoods referenced above but there are other other assumptions that must be considered.

Prior to removing outliers we transformed each variable and performed additional scatter plots for each scenario.  The lin-lin model shows a positive linear relationship, however there are outliers that have influence and leverage on the best fit.  The best visual model is a transformed model where Sales Price and Living Area are both transformed.  The R^2 for log-log is still rather insignificant at 48.5%, meaning the variation of Sales Price can be explained by 45% of Living Area.  Many of the outliers fall in the Edwards neighborhood - either by a single price or a few homes that greater than the mean.


Prior to removing outliers, let’s look at the residual plots.  Data is clustered near the right in the center and appears normal with a few outliers.  After removing the outliers the R^2 improved to 52.6%.  The residuals plots transformed and removing outliers also improved.  We can see the cluster still centered with minimal outliers having leverage or influence.  


















The Studentized histogram also confirms the normality of the data.




















Linearity is met with the Sales Price and Living Area both being transformed for homes in the NAmes, Edwards and BrkSide neighborhoods.
